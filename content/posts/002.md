## _Getting acquainted with MARKDOWN_.

I learned that **Markdown** is a markup language. That is, with it I can write and format text using specific characters to which specific functions are assigned.

The biggest advantage of **Markdown** is its versatility. Thanks to its simple notation, we are able to reproduce its contents in any text file and it is very readable in its original notation.

As I read on one English-language website, thanks to its simplicity, **Markdown** is _Future proof_.

I was playling with markdown. You can find the source .md file on my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Szymonbaczek/quickstart "GitHub source").

I was helped in my learning by this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uzpn2rmx_Fg "Markdown syntax")

## Table

Text 1|**Text 2**|_Text 3_.

## _2 Watch the video "[RWD starts with D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej_gwO9j1gc "RWD starts with D")"_.

**RWD** or **Responsive Web Design**.

After watching the video, I am richer with some fundamental information about creating the layout of content on a website in such a way that it is suitable for display on multiple devices, with different resolutions.

In my opinion, the most important lesson is to look at building a website as a , "living organism" that will adapt to the current environment and opportunities.

A website should not be a , "one fixed image", but a collection of elements that will find their place in different resolutions, together forming one coherent and functional whole.

## _3 Create a list of HTML and CSS courses_.
