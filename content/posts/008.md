## HTML

So much work done today. I'm tired and I don't have energy to write anythink here. Just look at my additional files with the same date. 

Everything I did today in HTML is in [here](https://github.com/Szymonbaczek/quickstart/blob/main/content/study-files/008html1.html "some html") and [here](https://github.com/Szymonbaczek/quickstart/blob/main/content/study-files/008html2.html "some more html")

## CSS

Everything in additional files.

Everything I did today in CSS is in [here](https://github.com/Szymonbaczek/quickstart/blob/main/content/study-files/008css1.css "some css") and [here](https://github.com/Szymonbaczek/quickstart/blob/main/content/study-files/008css2.css "some more css")

I fixed problem with Java Script by replacing (.nav) with (#nav), because I made div, not a class. I'm proud of myself because of that.

## GIT

git branch -f (main or something) (commit number or HEAD~(number)) 

git checkout HEAD~(number)

git reset HEAD~(number) - reseting changes

git revert (name of commit) - creates reverted copy of actual commit
