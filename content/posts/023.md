# Purchase of a domain

My blog is put up using Hugo's static page generator and using Netlify, which hosts this site. 

I had to buy a domain because the one from Netlify was a bunch of random words and numbers. 

A mentor recommended [porkbun.com](https://porkbun.com/ "porkbun.com") to me and suggested **.dev** as a top-level domain.
It would be suitable for me, as I want to become a web developer. 
However, it was a bit too expensive for me, since I live in Poland and dollars don't convert with my currency very optimistically :D

So I found **.win** for less than $4 per year and purchased it. I highly recommend the above mentioned site. Everything went smoothly and without complications.

I came up with the name ***simondev.win*** 
I think it is appropriate and quite , "professional".

# DNS problems

"Simply put, Domain Name System (DNS) is the phone book of the internet. Itâ€™s the system that converts website domain names (hostnames) into numerical values (IP address) so they can be found and loaded into your web browser." - [source](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/what-is-dns-how-it-works-domain-name-system "What's DNS")

So I understand it this way. Netlify as well as Porkbun wanted to set my DNS because they didn't know I was cheating them both :D 

I had to go to Netlify and make a deal with them. At first I only gave his DNS, but that didn't solve the problem, which was the non-working domain I had purchased. 

However, I found Netlify's instructions on what to do in such a situation, and it turned out that on Porkbun I had to set ALIAS in DNS to **,,answer = (link they gave me)"**.

I later verified the DNS in the DNS management section on Netlify and everything worked. ***Well... almost everything :)***
I will describe it in the next day.

# Unfortunate layouts :C

I am not yet at the stage where I fully understand the structure of my site's files - what is responsible for what. But I understand more and more every day, and that's what counts. Small but firm steps.

So, I wanted to change a few shortcomings of my blog, issues of post navigation. 

I moved the files responsible for this upside down and from left to right, tried to change the code I didn't understand and in the end I didn't come up with anything, I ran out of time. 

***But if I understand correctly, this is what it looks like to learn programming and then work. On many hours of searching for solutions.***
