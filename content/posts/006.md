## HTML

Everythink in additional files [here](https://github.com/Szymonbaczek/quickstart/blob/main/content/study-files/006html1.html "some html") and [here](https://github.com/Szymonbaczek/quickstart/blob/main/content/study-files/006html2.html "some more html")

All of that is based on Miros≈Çaw Zelent - Pasja Informatyki YouTube channel. He's a fameous programming teacher in Poland.

Div = divide

## GIT

git merge (1); (2) - connects commit with two parents above

git rebase (2) - creates copy of actual commit under the second one

I need to talk to my mentor about GIT, because I want to understand why am I doing this :)
