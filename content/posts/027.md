# GitHub Flow - The way of proper using GitHub and git

## How it works?

*The GitHub Flow* is a workflow designed to work well with Git and GitHub.
It focuses on branching and makes it possible for teams to experiment freely, and make deployments regularly.

**The mechanism is simple:** 
- Create a new Branch
- Make changes and add Commits
- Open a Pull Request
- Review
- Deploy
- Merge

I learned it in the amazing article made by w3schools. They did excelent work. It's really worth reading.

## Prerequisites

To follow GitHub flow, you will need a GitHub account and a repository. It's simplier than [GitFlow](https://simondev.win/posts/026/#gitflow---okay-we-have-git-but-we-also-need-flow "Git Flow article"), but it is also used in different app-developing strategies.

## What's it for?

As we work within *GitHub Flow* we want to release updates to our app very often, almost constantly. **I've heard that some companies realese new versions of their app even couple times a day!**

This approach is completely distinct from working with *GitFlow*, where we want to realesa changes once per two weeks or so.
