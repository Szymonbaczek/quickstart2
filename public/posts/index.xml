      <description>A week off I was absent for a week, due to my position in life. I am in the last year of high school and I am preparing for The Final Exam, so I don&amp;rsquo;t have much time nowadays. I&amp;rsquo;m explaining myself here only in front of&amp;hellip; myself! I feel bad when I can&amp;rsquo;t pay that much atention to study programming as I should, so I&amp;rsquo;m about to changing that. Work daily Simon, small steps - but daily.</description>

      <description>Looking for a solution to a problem with my Mentor We connected through discord, the bot no longer reminds us of meetings because flexibility works better than top-down fixed days and times for meetings.
I introduced my mentor to my blog and told him how I created it. I also talked about the problems I encountered along the way and the ones I am currently facing.
Another domain problem needed to be fix When you typed in the name of my new domain simondev.</description>

      <description>Purchase of a domain My blog is put up using Hugo&amp;rsquo;s static page generator and using Netlify, which hosts this site.
I had to buy a domain because the one from Netlify was a bunch of random words and numbers.
A mentor recommended porkbun.com to me and suggested .dev as a top-level domain. It would be suitable for me, as I want to become a web developer. However, it was a bit too expensive for me, since I live in Poland and dollars don&amp;rsquo;t convert with my currency very optimistically :D</description>

      <description>Summary of previous months and some conclusions So I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed how big mistake I&amp;rsquo;ve done.

      <description>I A Git workflow is a recipe or recommendation for how to use Git to accomplish work in a consistent and productive manner.
Workflows are designed to be guidelines rather than concrete rules.
The Centralized Workflow uses a central repository to serve as the single point-of-entry for all changes to the project. This workflow doesnâ€™t require any other branches besides &amp;ldquo;main&amp;rdquo;.
The core idea behind The Feature Branch Workflow is that all feature development should take place in a dedicated branch instead of the main branch.</description>

      <description>Ultra gitbranch note PART 1/2 Local What&amp;rsquo;s GIT? It&amp;rsquo;s the most popular version control system (and I finally understand what it means).
What&amp;rsquo;s GIT for? It records changes made to our code over time in a special data base - REPOSITORY. It also give as an opportunity to work with someone else on the same project in the same time.
In favour of that we can look at our project history and see who and when made which changes.</description>

      <description>Difference between mobile first and desktop first design It&amp;rsquo;s all about priority.
You have the oportunnity to choose what&amp;rsquo;s more important for your clients / users of your website.
In desktop first design we focus on making good-looking website on desktop devices and then we think how to convert it or how to prepare that site for mobile screens.
In mobile first design, we do straight opposite. We start with building functional and pretty mobile website and then we think what to add, that we use whole desktop potential.</description>

      <description>Getting acquainted with MARKDOWN. I learned that Markdown is a markup language. That is, with it I can write and format text using specific characters to which specific functions are assigned.
The biggest advantage of Markdown is its versatility. Thanks to its simple notation, we are able to reproduce its contents in any text file and it is very readable in its original notation.
As I read on one English-language website, thanks to its simplicity, Markdown is Future proof.</description>
