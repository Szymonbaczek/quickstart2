      <description>Ultra gitbranch note PART 1/2 Local What&amp;rsquo;s GIT? It&amp;rsquo;s the most popular version control system (and I finally understand what it means).
What&amp;rsquo;s GIT for? It records changes made to our code over time in a special data base - REPOSITORY. It also give as an opportunity to work with someone else on the same project in the same time.
In favour of that we can look at our project history and see who and when made which changes.</description>
