      <description>I A Git workflow is a recipe or recommendation for how to use Git to accomplish work in a consistent and productive manner.
Workflows are designed to be guidelines rather than concrete rules.
The Centralized Workflow uses a central repository to serve as the single point-of-entry for all changes to the project. This workflow doesnâ€™t require any other branches besides &amp;ldquo;main&amp;rdquo;.
The core idea behind The Feature Branch Workflow is that all feature development should take place in a dedicated branch instead of the main branch.</description>

      <description>Difference between mobile first and desktop first design It&amp;rsquo;s all about priority.
You have the oportunnity to choose what&amp;rsquo;s more important for your clients / users of your website.
In desktop first design we focus on making good-looking website on desktop devices and then we think how to convert it or how to prepare that site for mobile screens.
In mobile first design, we do straight opposite. We start with building functional and pretty mobile website and then we think what to add, that we use whole desktop potential.</description>
