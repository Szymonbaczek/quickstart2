      <description>Looking for a solution to a problem with my Mentor We connected through discord, the bot no longer reminds us of meetings because flexibility works better than top-down fixed days and times for meetings.
I introduced my mentor to my blog and told him how I created it. I also talked about the problems I encountered along the way and the ones I am currently facing.
Another domain problem needed to be fix When you typed in the name of my new domain simondev.</description>

      <description>Purchase of a domain My blog is put up using Hugo&amp;rsquo;s static page generator and using Netlify, which hosts this site.
I had to buy a domain because the one from Netlify was a bunch of random words and numbers.
A mentor recommended porkbun.com to me and suggested .dev as a top-level domain. It would be suitable for me, as I want to become a web developer. However, it was a bit too expensive for me, since I live in Poland and dollars don&amp;rsquo;t convert with my currency very optimistically :D</description>

      <description>Summary of previous months and some conclusions So I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed how big mistake I&amp;rsquo;ve done.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t make notes about anything I&amp;rsquo;ve done and learned during the last dozens of days.
I learned how to deploy a site (like this blog) using static site generator like Hugo. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned how it works and how can I menega this kind of sites.
I&amp;rsquo;ve done some exercises that kept me in ,,programming&amp;quot; form.</description>
